    <h3>History of Qualcomm Software</h3>
    <p>In 1985, seven former Linkabit colleagues met in Irwin Jacobs's home to create a company that would build “QUALity COMMunications.” These visionaries departed from the accepted telecommunications standards at the time to develop Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), forever changing wireless communications.</p>
