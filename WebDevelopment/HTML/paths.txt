paths - absolute path & relative path
Image that we are talkin about is entri.jpg
Relative paths
-> src="entri.jpg" - in the same folder as this file
-> src="images/entri.jpg" - in the images folder and images folder is in the same folder as this file.
-> src="/images/entri.jpg" - in the images folder and images folder is at the root directory
-> src="../entri.jpg" - in the images folder and images folder is one level up from the folder where this file is present.
